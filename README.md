This Rust program finds the generators of the additive group Z_n using the `num-bigint` crate for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
The program takes a large integer n and finds all the generators of the additive group Z_n. 
A generator of Z_n is an element g such that the sequence g, 2g, 3g, ..., (n-1)g modulo n  produces all distinct elements of Z_n.
